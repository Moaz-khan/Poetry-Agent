## ðŸ§© How It Works

1. A two-line poem (sher) is passed to the Poetry Classifier Agent.
2. The agent analyzes:
   - Tone
   - Structure
   - Intent
3. It then classifies the poem as:
   - `Dramatic`
   - `Narrative`
   - `Lyric`
4. Based on the classification, the poem is forwarded to the relevant agent for commentary or explanation.
